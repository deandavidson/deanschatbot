Hello!

This is an AI chatbot that I have named "Dean's Chatbot".

In this application, I used react and the openai API to create a seamless
interface for the user to gain knowledge of anything in the world, right at
their fingertips.

To run this application in your browser, simply follow these steps:
    1. Fork and clone down this repository to your local machine

    3. In your terminal type: npm install
    4. In your terminal type: npm run dev
    5. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173/
    6. Ask Dean's Chatbot any question you might have!
